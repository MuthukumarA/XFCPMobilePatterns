# Xamarin Forms Cross Platform Mobile Patterns Demo
This project is a distinctive demonstration of different Cross Platform Mobile Development Patterns with Xamarin Forms regarding sharing code among PCLs and Platform-specific Implementations, focusing on the famous Factory Pattern, Service Locator Pattern, and Dependency Injection with IoC.
This is purely for educational purposes only.

This project demonstrates a simple Note taking app (My Notes App) which allows the user to save the notes locally on the phone, and view them as well as read the notes out loud using text to speech capabilities.
The app uses native implementation to save the notes locally and the text to speech feature, where as those implementation demonstrates how the different patterns can be used distinctively.

This includes 3 projects demonstrating the key implementation patterns of the same app concept.

XFMyNotesAppFP - Factory Pattern

XFMyNotesAppSL - Service Locator Pattern

XFMyNotesAppDI - Dependency Injection with IoC
