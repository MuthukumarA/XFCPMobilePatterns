# Xamarin Forms Cross Platform Mobile Patterns Demo
This project is a distinctive demonstration of different Cross Platform Mobile Development Patterns with Xamarin Forms regarding implemeting loosely-coupled shared code among PCL and Platform-specific projects, focusing on the famous Factory Pattern, Service Locator Pattern, and Dependency Injection with IoC.
This is purely for educational purposes only.

This project demonstrates a simple Note taking app (My Notes App) which allows the user to add notes, save them locally on the phone, and view them, as well as reading the notes using built-in platform-specific text to speech engines.
It demonstrates how we could manage Platform-specific implementation with PCLs in loosely-coupled manner using standard patterns.

This includes 3 projects demonstrating the key implementation patterns of the same app concept as follows.

XFMyNotesAppFP - Factory Pattern

XFMyNotesAppSL - Service Locator Pattern

XFMyNotesAppDI - Dependency Injection with IoC
